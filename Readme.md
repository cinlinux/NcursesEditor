#### text editor

That project based on ncursec and system calls for file read and write. 
And buffered file read and write.

#### Need to use:
- [ ] open(fd...) ; write(); lseek(); seccur(); sync(); readv(); writev();
- [ ] fopen(); fileno(); fread(); fwrite(); fflush(); fseek(); rewind(); setvbuf();
- [ ] override system calls SIGTERM etc.
